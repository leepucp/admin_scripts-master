# usage: ./hft_test.sh input_csv_address machine
#
# runs the hft game commands specified in the input csv downloaded from 'input_csv_address' on 'machine'
#
# input csvs have a row for each desired command
# each row has three columns: a timestamp in ms, a command and an argument
# the usable commands are OUT, SNIPE, MAKER, SPEED_ON, SPEED_OFF and SPREAD
# only the SPREAD command uses the third argument column, which it uses for the new desired spread

# I can't comment inside the string, so I'll just describe what it's doing here
# export is required to make xdotool work. I don't know why. I got it from berserck.sh
# start holds the start time for the script. the date | cut expression gets the current time in ms
# wget downloads the input csv from dropbox
# the first while loop reads each row of the csv into a variable for each col (TIMESTAMP, CMD and ARG)
# the second while loop checks to see if the current time minus the start time is less than the timestamp for that row
# if it is, sleep for 100ms and try again
# once current time minus start time is greater than or equal to timestamp, that row's command is ready to be sent
# this layout requires that input csv rows be ordered by timestamp
# the case expression just chooses the appropriate xdotool command for each input command
# only spread uses the third arg column
# lastly it removes the downloaded csv
